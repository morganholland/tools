Create a new single-file HTML tool based on this description: $ARGUMENTS

Follow the guidelines in CLAUDE.md strictly:
- Single HTML file with inline CSS and JS
- No React, Vue, or any framework requiring build steps
- Use CDN (unpkg, cdnjs, esm.sh) for any external libraries
- Include viewport meta tag for mobile responsiveness
- Use semantic HTML and clean, readable code

Common patterns to include where applicable:
- Copy-to-clipboard buttons for outputs
- URL query parameters for shareable state
- localStorage for persisting user preferences
- Drag-and-drop file upload if dealing with files
- Clear visual feedback for user actions

Save the file to the repository root with a descriptive kebab-case filename (e.g., `json-formatter.html`).

After creating the file, offer to open it in the browser for testing.
