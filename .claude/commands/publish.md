Publish tools to GitHub Pages.

Steps:
1. Run `git status` to see what's changed
2. Show a summary of new/modified HTML tools
3. Stage all changes with `git add .`
4. Create a commit with a descriptive message summarizing the changes
5. Push to the main branch

After pushing, remind the user that tools will be available at:
`https://{username}.github.io/tools/{filename}.html`

Note: GitHub Pages must be enabled for the repository (Settings > Pages > Source: main branch).
