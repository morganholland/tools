# Tools

A collection of single-file HTML tools—standalone applications combining HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that require no build steps, no servers, and no frameworks.

Inspired by [Simon Willison's HTML tools](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/).

## Usage

Each tool is a self-contained HTML file. Open directly in a browser or access via GitHub Pages:
